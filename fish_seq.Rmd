## Model Description

This program runs and outputs results of an agent-based model developed in NetLogo (Wilensky, 1999). The model simulates the dynamics of the capture, re-capture problem in animal populations. The environment is a 70 x 70 grid space. The fish agents move ("swim") on a grid space and are "captured" if they swim across a capture line (net). Fish are assumed to be immediately placed back into into the environments where they can potentially be re-captured. The user can select values for several parameters, including the size of the fish population, the length of the capture line, the number of fish to capture at a time, and the total captures to simulate.

This model builds on the netlogo Flocking model of birds (Wilensky, 1998). For more details on the model, please see the 'Info' tab in Fish.nlogo.

## Parameter Settings

#### Population Parameters
The population size can be defined or the simulation can draw the size of the population from an exponential distribution. 

Population size drawn from exponential distribution: `r params$population_from_distribution`  
Mean population size (if drawing from exponential distribution): `r params$population_mean`  
Population size (if not pulling from exponential distribution): `r params$population`  

#### Capture Parameters
A capture session can last either for a predefined number of ticks (capture time) or until a certain number of fish have been "caught" (number of fish to capture).  

Length of fish net (in parcels): `r params$capture_line_length`  
Time between captures (in ticks): `r params$time_between_captures`
Use capture time:  `r params$use_capture_time`  
Capture time (in ticks) (if use capture time is true):  `r params$capture_time_line`  
Number of fish to capture at each session (if use capture time is false):  `r params$num_to_capture` 
 
#### Simulation Parameters
The simulation will run into its completed all of the capture sessions.  

Number of capture sessions:  `r params$total_captures`  
Number of runs:  `r params$runs`  


```{r netlogo}
# function to run netlogo and place results in a dataframe

# to ensure we're doing the correct number of runs, make any necessary parameter adjustments given certain criteria

  # run fish model at the new run
out <- run_netlogo(parameters.newrun, params$nl.path, params$nl.jarname, params$model.path, params$runs, params$num_cores)

## Organize the new design and data: 
data_new <-filter(out, captured==TRUE) # filter for fish that were captured at least once
data_new <-filter(data_new, capture_num <= params$total_captures) # filter out any fish that may have been caught in extra capture at end of simulation
# count number of fish caught in second capture that were also caught in first capture
data_new <- filter(data_new, capture_num < 3)
data_new <- group_by(data_new, who, runID, population_size) %>% summarise(captures = n())

## TODO: This step can lead to empty data_new when no fish recaptured: 
data_new <- filter(data_new, captures == 2) %>% group_by(., runID, population_size) %>% summarise(recaptures=n())
}

## Record new design in integer:
X_ori  <- c(X_ori, data_new$population_size) # in original scale

## Collect new data: 

Ynew <- data_new$recaptures
Y <- c(Y, Ynew)

## update the model:
mod.a <- update(mod.a, Xnew = opt$par, Znew = Ynew, ginit = mod.a$g * 1.01)

## Periodically restart MLE calculation:
if(i %% 10 == 0){ mod2 <- mleHetGP(X = list(X0 = mod.a$X0, Z0 = mod.a$Z0, mult = mod.a$mult), Z = mod.a$Z, lower = 0.0001, upper = 1)
if(mod2$ll > mod.a$ll) mod.a <- mod2
}

## Save sequential simulated data:
write.csv(data_seq, file = "GridData.csv",row.names=FALSE)
